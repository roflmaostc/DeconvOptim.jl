"""
    deconvolution(measured, psf; <keyword arguments>)

Computes the deconvolution of `measured` and `psf`. Return parameter is a tuple with
two elements. The first entry is the deconvolved image. The second return parameter 
is the output of the optimization of Optim.jl

Multiple keyword arguments can be specified for different loss functions,
regularizers and mappings.

# Arguments
- `loss=Poisson()`: the loss function taking a vector the same shape as measured. 
- `regularizer=GR()`: A regularizer function, same form as `loss`.
- `λ=0.05`: A float indicating the total weighting of the regularizer with 
    respect to the global loss function
- `background=0`: A float indicating a background intensity level.
- `mapping=Non_negative()`: Applies a mapping of the optimizer weight. Default is a 
              parabola which achieves a non-negativity constraint.
- `iterations=20`: Specifies a number of iterations after the optimization.
    definitely should stop.
- `conv_dims`: A tuple indicating over which dimensions the convolution should happen.
               per default `conv_dims=1:ndims(psf)`
- `plan_fft=true`: Boolean whether plan_fft is used. Gives a slight speed improvement.
- `padding=0`: an float indicating the amount (fraction of the size in that dimension) 
        of padded regions around the reconstruction. Prevents wrap around effects of the FFT.
        A array with `size(arr)=(400, 400)` with `padding=0.05` would result in reconstruction size of 
        `(440, 440)`. However, we only return the reconstruction cropped to the original size.
        `padding=0` disables any padding.
- `optim_options=nothing`: Can be a options file required by Optim.jl. Will overwrite iterations.
- `optim_optimizer=LBFGS()`: The chosen Optim.jl optimizer. 


# Example
```julia-repl
julia> using DeconvOptim, TestImages, Colors, Noise;

julia> img = Float32.(testimage("resolution_test_512"));

julia> psf = Float32.(generate_psf(size(img), 30));

julia> img_b = conv_psf(img, psf);

julia> img_n = poisson(img_b, 300);

julia> @time res, o = deconvolution(img_n, psf);
```
