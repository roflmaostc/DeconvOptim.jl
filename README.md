A package for microscopy image based deconvolution via Optim.jl. This package works with N dimensional <a href="https://github.com/RainerHeintzmann/PointSpreadFunctions.jl">Point Spread Functions</a> and images.
The package was created with microscopy in mind but since the code base is quite general it is possible to deconvolve different kernels as well.

## Installation
Type `]`in the REPL to get to the package manager:
```julia
julia> ] add DeconvOptim
```

## Documentation
The documentation of the latest release is [here](docs-stable-url).
The documentation of current master is [here](docs-dev-url).
For a quick introduction you can also watch the presentation at the JuliaCon 2021.

## Usage
A quick example is shown below.
```julia
using DeconvOptim, TestImages, Colors, ImageIO, Noise, ImageShow

# load test image
img = Float32.(testimage("resolution_test_512"))

# generate simple Point Spread Function of aperture radius 30
psf = Float32.(generate_psf(size(img), 30))

# create a blurred, noisy version of that image
img_b = conv(img, psf)
img_n = poisson(img_b, 300)

# deconvolve 2D with default options
@time res, o = deconvolution(img_n, psf)

# deconvolve 2D with no regularizer
@time res_no_reg, o = deconvolution(img_n, psf, regularizer=nothing)

# show final results next to original and blurred version
Gray.([img img_n res])
```

## Examples
Have a quick look into the [examples folder](examples).
We demonstrate the effect of different regularizers. There is also a [CUDA example](examples/cuda_2D.ipynb). 
Using regularizers together with a CUDA GPU is faster but unfortunately only a factor of ~5-10.
For [3D](examples/cuda_3D.ipynb) the speed-up is larger.

## CUDA
For CUDA we only provide a Total variation regularizer via `TV_cuda`. The reason is that Tullio.jl is currently not very fast with `CuArray`s and especially
the derivative of such functions.

## Performance Tips
### Regularizers
The regularizers are generated with metaprogramming when `TV()` (or any other regularizer) is called. To prevent that the code
compile every time again, define the regularizer once and use it multiple times without newly defining it:
```julia
reg = TV()
```
And in the new cell then use:
```julia
res, o = deconvolution(img_n, psf, regularizer=reg)
```

## Development
Feel free to file an issue regarding problems, suggestions or improvement ideas for this package!
We would be happy to deconvolve *real* data! File an issue if we can help deconvolving an image/stack. We would be also excited to adapt DeconvOptim.jl to your special needs!


## Contributions
I would like to thank [Rainer Heintzmann](https://nanoimaging.de/) for the great support and discussions during development.
Furthermore without [Tullio.jl](https://github.com/mcabbott/Tullio.jl) and [@mcabbott](https://github.com/mcabbott/) this package wouldn't be as fast as it is. His package and ideas are the basis for the implementations of the regularizers.
