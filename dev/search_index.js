Since we interpret deconvolution as an optimization we initialize the reconstruction variables rec.  rec is a array of pixels which are the variables we are optimizing for. Then we can apply some mapping eg. to reconstruct only pixels having non-negative intensity values. Afterwards we compose the total loss functions. It consists of a regularizing part (weighted with lambda) and a loss part. The latter one compares the current reconstruction with the measured image. Total loss adds both values to a single scalar value. Using Zygote.jl we calculate the gradient with respect to all pixel values of rec. Note, Zygote.jl calculates the gradient with a reverse mode. From performance point of view, that is necessary since the loss function is a mapping from many pixels to a single value (texttotal loss mathbbR^N mapsto mathbbR). We can plug this gradient and the loss function into Optim.jl. Optim.jl then minimizes this loss function. The different parts of the pipeline (mapping, forward, regularizer) can be exchanged and adapted to the users needs. In most cases changing the regularizer or the number of iterations is enough.","category":"page"},{"location":"workflow/basic_workflow/","page":"Basic Workflow","title":"Basic Workflow","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"workflow/basic_workflow/","page":"Basic Workflow","title":"Basic Workflow","text":"For all options, see the function references.

These lenses support only certain frequencies and weaken the contrast of high frequency content. Furthermore, in many cases Poisson or Gaussian noise is introduced by the  quantum nature of light (Poisson shot noise) or sensors (readout noise). DeconvOptim.jl is a Julia solution to deconvolution reducing the blur of lenses and denoising the image. Our framework relies on several other tools: The deconvolution problem is stated as a convex optimization problem via a loss function. Hence we make use of Optim.jl and especially fast solvers like L-BFGS. Since such solvers require gradients (of the loss function) we use automatic differentiation (AD) offered by Zygote.jl for that. Of course, one could derive the gradient by hand, however that's error-prone and for some regularizers hard to do by hand. Furthermore, fast AD of the regularizers is hard to achieve if the gradients are written with for loops. Fortunately Tullio.jl provides an extensive and fast framework to get expressions which can derived by the AD in acceptable speed.","category":"page"},{"location":"#Installation","page":"DeconvOptim.jl","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"DeconvOptim.jl","title":"DeconvOptim.jl","text":"To get the latest stable release of DeconvOptim.jl type ] in the Julia REPL:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"DeconvOptim.jl","title":"DeconvOptim.jl","text":"] add DeconvOptim","category":"page"},{"location":"#Quick-Example","page":"DeconvOptim.jl","title":"Quick Example","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"DeconvOptim.jl","title":"DeconvOptim.jl","text":"Below is a quick example how to deconvolve a image which is blurred with a Gaussian Kernel.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"DeconvOptim.jl","title":"DeconvOptim.jl","text":"using DeconvOptim, TestImages, Colors, ImageIO, Noise, ImageShow\n\n# load test image\nimg = Float32.(testimage(\"resolution_test_512\"))\n\n# generate simple Point Spread Function of aperture radius 30\npsf = Float32.(generate_psf(size(img), 30))\n\n# create a blurred, noisy version of that image\nimg_b = conv(img, psf)\nimg_n = poisson(img_b, 300)\n\n# deconvolve 2D with default options\n@time res, o = deconvolution(img_n, psf)\n\n# deconvolve 2D with no regularizer\n@time res_no_reg, o = deconvolution(img_n, psf, regularizer=nothing)\n\n# show final results next to original and blurred version\nGray.([img img_n res])","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"DeconvOptim.jl","title":"DeconvOptim.jl","text":"Left image is the sample.
